# Adaptive Handover Optimization in Open RAN

This project explores adaptive handover optimization in Open RAN environments using deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques.

Developed as part of an M.Tech Mini Project, the work focuses on LSTM-based temporal modeling and PPO-based reinforcement learning to improve handover decisions in dynamic telecom environments. The LSTM model achieved up to **86.67% accuracy**, and **INT8 quantization** was applied to reduce the model size by **86.9%** for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Integration with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in real-time control systems.

> **Note:** Due to ongoing work on related paper publications, the source code is not publicly shared at this time.
